Back before before joining the [Appcelerator](http://www.appcelerator.com/) team about a year and a half ago, I was working a typical 9 to 5 enterprise development job. While this was nothing more than a paycheck, it did afford me copious amounts of time to experiment on personal projects before I finally fell in love with cross-platform mobile development. My first true love in this experimental coding was interactive 3D using Flash and [Away3D](http://away3d.com/).

I had always been a back-end dev, mostly C/C++, working on Linux servers for about the first 7 years of my career. With these experiments, I wanted to get way out of my comfort zone. I wanted to not just learn a new programming language and tooling, but entirely new concepts for interacting with computers. To this end, I dove head-long into learning Away3D with the express purpose of developing demos that had no goal other than pure coding fun.

While I never really became much more than a novice-intermediate 3D developer, I did crank out of a bunch of cool looking demos, not to mention made tons of friends and contacts in the Flash/Flex/AS3 world. If it wasn't for those guys, I wouldn't be the Twitter junkie I am today, which directly led to my current job with Appcelerator (_just ask [this guy](https://twitter.com/fusion94)_). In short, these seemingly purposeless experiments led to the most amazing experiences thus far in my professional career.

And without further ado, dug up from the archives of my [old blog](http://savagelook.com/blog/) I present most of the aforementioned experiments in Flash and Away3D. Enjoy!
