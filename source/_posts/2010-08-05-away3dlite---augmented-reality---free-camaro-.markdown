As promised the demo above includes bare bones source code (right click to view source)  for getting FLARManager up and running with Away3dLite.  And for a limited time, it comes with your very own Camaro!  99% of the credit goes to Eric Socolofsky as the code is just a trimmed down version of his example code included in FLARManager.  The model has been provided free by the modeler "Race Tracks" at <a href="http://www.turbosquid.com/FullPreview/Index.cfm/ID/310098" target="_blank">turbosquid</a>.  In order to use this demo, you need to do the following:

* Download and print <a href="http://www.savagelook.com/demos/augmented_reality/resources/flar/patterns/patt001.png" target="_blank">this marker</a>
* Turn on your webcam and point it at yourself.
* Start the demo, point the printed marker at the webcam, and enjoy!

If the above steps aren't clear, check out the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYBgPjxeQ-8" target="_blank">video demo from my prior blog post</a>.  For those out there constantly evaluating how far we can push the performance of away3dlite, you might like to know that the model consists of right around 1000 faces.  1000+ faces along with the video processing of patterns and I'm still maintaining right around 30 FPS.  Not bad at all.
