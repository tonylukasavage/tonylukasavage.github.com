I'm starting to cook up a few game ideas with some friends of mine and I wanted to get a sense of what Away3D could really do.  To start, I made this very basic example of Away3D loading a fairly high poly 3DS file with minimal animation.  More specifically, it's a rotating, 2880 poly, torus knot with a wire frame material.  While Away3D isn't really made to handle models with this many polys, it gives me an idea of how it will handle a total polycount of about 3000.
