    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Gonzo</h2>




<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/downloads/tonylukasavage/Gonzo/Gonzo_0.1.0_alpha.air">Gonzo 0.1.0 alpha release Air installer</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tonylukasavage/Gonzo">Gonzo on Github</a></li>
</ul>




<p>Gonzo is a lightweight, open source markdown editor written for Adobe Air for desktop using Flex 4 and AS3.  Its a stripped-to-the-bone application that serves one purpose: helping you deliver well formed and easy to proofread web content.</p>




<p><img src="http://tonylukasavage.github.com/images/gonzo_final.jpg" alt="Gonzo, the lightweight markdown editor" title="" /></p>




<h2>Why use markdown, I already know HTML?</h2>




<p>Rather than drone on about the pros and cons of each, I'll just present you with a simple example. You let me know which version you would rather proofread.</p>




<h3>HTML version</h3>


<p>```</p>

<h2>Here's a header</h2>




<p>Here's some content in a paragraph. And here's a link to <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> and another to my <a href="https://github.com/tonylukasavage">Github</a> account.</p>




<p>And here's another paragraph
    <blockquote>this time it contains a blockquote</blockquote>
</p>




<ul>
    <li>One of these lists' syntax</li>
    <li>has the following attributes:</li>
    <li>
        <ul>
            <li><b>intrusive</b></li>
            <li><b>ugly</b></li>
            <li><b>very hard to read</b></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>which one do you think it is?</li>
</ul>


<p>```</p>

<h3>Markdown version</h3>


<p>```</p>

<h2>Here's a header</h2>

<p>Here's some content in a paragraph. And here's a link to <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> and another to my <a href="https://github.com/tonylukasavage">Github</a> account.</p></p>

<p>And here's another paragraph</p>

<blockquote><p>this time it contains a blockquote</p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li>One of these lists' syntax</li>
<li>has the following attributes:

<ul>
<li>intrusive</li>
<li>ugly</li>
<li>very hard to read</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>which one do you think it is?</li>
</ul>


<p>```</p>

<h2>Why should you use Gonzo?</h2>




<p>Well, unless you are writing content for the web, you probably shouldn't.  Gonzo is written specifically for those who want to leverage the readability of markdown over HTML when publishing web content.  So whether you are writing a Wordpress blog post, editing a wiki, or even just an answering a question on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">StackOverflow</a>, Gonzo can make your life a whole lot easier.</p>




<p>In the spirit of markdown, I've added just enough features to increase efficiency while maintaining a content-driven writing experience. The idea is to only add features necessary for making web publishing easier.  All the effort saved by not implementing useless features was redirected into usability.</p>




<h2>Just Give Me The Feature List Already</h2>




<p>Yeah, I tend to skip the text and go right for the feature list too. Kudos to anyone who actually read the previous content before coming here.</p>




<ul>
<li><strong>Live HTML preview</strong> - You can actually see the raw and rendered HTML generated by your markdown in a preview pane.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-tab editing</strong> - Edit many documents at the same time.</li>
<li><strong>Cross platform</strong> - Works on any desktop that supports Adobe Air. </li>
<li><strong>Keyboard and (context) menu shortcuts</strong> - Creating markdown is even easier now with multiple was to create it.</li>
<li><strong>HTML Export</strong> - Export your generated HTML to a file so it can easily be uploaded or shared.</li>
<li><strong>Cheat Sheet</strong> - integrated markdown cheat sheet for beginners and vets alike.</li>
</ul>




<h2>Coming soon...</h2>




<p>This is the list of features I personally would like to have, as I'm the only user so far. Please let me know what <em>you</em> think would be a good addition to Gonzo's functionality.</p>




<ul>
<li><strong>yfrog integration</strong> - Wouldn't it be nice to browse to a file on your desktop, upload it as an image, and get a markdown link placed in your document in one click?  I think so too.</li>
<li><strong>bit.ly integration</strong> - see above </li>
<li><strong>Markdown toolbar shortcuts</strong> - Just in case the keyboard, context menu, and native menu shortcuts aren't enough...</li>
<li><strong>Preferences</strong> - Let users set things like fonts, colors, editor sizes, and eventually maybe even theming. </li>
<li><strong>Local settings</strong> - For persisting preferences between Gonzo sessions</li>
</ul>




<p>What else do you have in mind?</p>




<h2>Want to Contribute?</h2>




<p>Good! Like most open source projects, ongoing development will be heavily motivated by contributions and feedback from its community of developers and users. While Gonzo will continue to grow as I use and find features I want, its going to be you who determines if it matures into an application for the masses.</p>




<p>There's a number of ways you can contribute:</p>




<ul>
<li>Use it and let me know what you think.
<ul><li>What is it missing?</li>
<li>What am I doing wrong</li>
<li>What am I doing right?</li></ul></li>
<li>Fork <a href="https://github.com/tonylukasavage/Gonzo">Gonzo on Github</a>, start hacking away, and send me some pull requests. I'm very open to help, but bear in mind that its lightweight nature and usability should not be sacrificed for the sake of features.</li>
<li>Design help is very welcome. I'm a dev through and through, so it will remain spartan in frills unless someone else decides to add the polish.</li>
</ul>




<h2>Summary</h2>




<p>There's a lot to come yet for Gonzo. I still need to get the wiki up and running for basic docs.  I may even take the time to make a web page for it if it garners enough interest. Or none of this could happen and I could just continue to use it myself. Only time and feedback will tell.</p>




<p>If you do start using or hacking Gonzo, you can let me know here, on <a href="https://github.com/tonylukasavage/Gonzo">Github</a>, or on <a href="http://twitter.com/tonylukasavage">Twitter</a>.  I'd love to hear about your experience. In the meantime I'll continue using it to write my web content and keep improving it as I see fit.</p>




<p>Oh, and this entire post was written in markdown using Gonzo.  Here's a link to the <a href="http://savagelook.com/misc/gonzo.md.text">original markdown</a> for the blog post.</p>

    <id>http://tonylukasavage.github.com/blog/2011/06/22/taking-notes-on-node-js-using-gonzo</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Gonzo</h2>

<p>In case you haven't heard me talking about it on <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/tonylukasavage">Twitter</a>, I'm creating my own markdown editor called <a href="https://github.com/tonylukasavage/Gonzo">Gonzo</a>. If you don't know what markdown is, read up on it at <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">John Gruber's (creator) blog</a>.  It was created as a way to make web based writing more readable from a writer's perspective.</p>

<p>Here's some of the highlights of the VERY young <strong>Gonzo</strong>:</p>

<ul style="padding-bottom:15px;">
<li>Its open source and <a href="https://github.com/tonylukasavage/Gonzo">hosted on Github</a></lI>
<li>Its written using Adobe Air for desktop, Flex 4, and AS3</lI>
<li>The markdown to HTML parsing is done using <a href="https://gist.github.com/648771">Charles Strahan's Showdown.as</a></lI>
<li>Uses <a href="http://gskinner.com/blog/archives/2007/04/free_extension.html">Grant Skinner's StringUtils.as</a></lI>
<li>Its <strong>3 days old</strong> as of the publishing date of the article</lI>
<li>It generates HTML as you type markdown and shows it live in a preview panel</lI>
<li>Counts your words for those web writers trying to hit quotas</lI>
</ul>


<h2>Test Run</h2>

<p>Last night I took <strong>Gonzo</strong> for its maiden voyage in "production." I went to a meetup of the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-JavaScript-Developers/">Pittsburgh Javascript Developers</a> and discussed <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>.  I've never looked at Node.js before as server side Javascript always seemed like the avenue of a one trick pony.  After shedding my preconceived notions, it became apparent that using one language throughout your entire technology stack could work miracles with your efficiency.  But its young, alpha, and it changes a lot.</p>

<p>Rather than ramble on from a beginner's stand point, I'll leave you with the notes I took last night at the meetup using <strong>Gonzo</strong>.  First, I'll show you the notes as I entered into <strong>Gonzo</strong>.  Like I said at the beginning, if markdown is unfamiliar, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">read up</a>.  Just one glance shows you how much more readable and editable it is than typical HTML markup.</p>

<h2>My Notes in Markdown</h2>

<p>```</p>

<h2>Node.js</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<ul>
<li>Server side JS.</li>
<li>HTTP/TCP built in</li>
<li>non-blocking, event driven, 1 thread (launches process into event queue)</li>
<li>not suitable for CPU intensive work</li>
<li>Node.js is alpha and changes a lot between revisions</li>
<li>for unix, not Windows friendly</li>
<li>everything is a callback and gets its own process

<ul>
<li>lots of nested callbacks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>has to run from command line, no GUI for management.</li>
<li>you can use it as a scripting language like ruby or perl

<ul>
<li>does not have to be event driven if ran this way.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Having it server side allows you to use JS up and down your whole technology stack</li>
</ul>


<h3>NPM</h3>

<ul>
<li>Node package managaer</li>
<li>A lot like CPAN for perl</li>
</ul>


<h3>Modules</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/modules">100's of modules</a></li>
<li>examples

<ul>
<li>Sizzle

<ul>
<li>DOM selections and traversing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Paperboy

<ul>
<li>serves static files</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Jade

<ul>
<li>templating engine</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ExpressJS

<ul>
<li>web framework</li>
<li>use it to deliver RESTful services</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>zombie headless browser

<ul>
<li>useful for testing Node driven services</li>
<li>assertions against returned data</li>
<li>DOM traversing is all custom code (why?!)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Coffeescript</li>
<li>multiple cores w/ web workers</li>
<li>Node Inspector

<ul>
<li>debugger

<ul>
<li>breakpoints</li>
<li>call stack</li>
<li>watch expressions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>command line</li>
<li>runs in a webkit browser</li>
<li>based on google's v8 engine</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Basic Server</h3>

<pre><code>var http = require("http");

http.createServer(function (request, response) {
    response.writeHead("Content-Type: "text/html");
    response.write("&lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;");
    response.end();
}).listen(8081);
</code></pre>

<h3>Emitters</h3>

<p>Emitters are used to counter nesting of code. Should probably use constants to define emitter names. Add parameters afer emitter name in <code>emit()</code> to pass to callback.</p>

<pre><code>emitter.emit('eventName', param1, param2);
emitter.on('eventName', function(param1, param2) {
    // do stuff
});
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>And now, through the magic of <strong>Gonzo</strong> and Showdown.as, we get to see the markdown translated into HTML.  You can then take the translated HTML and publish it to the web, allowing it to leverage any CSS and formatting your target venue has in place.  Again, notice how much more readable the markdown version is than this HTML version.</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>And finally below is the above generated HTML copied directly into my blog.  The CSS that governs my blog does its work on the elements and makes it look relatively web ready.  Obviously if I put a little more effort in (as I will soon), I can tailor the CSS to play well with my generated HTML.  For now, though, you can see the basic formatting applied.  So without cluttering your writing with HTML you can still effortlessly generate web ready content.</p>

<h2>Screenshot of Gonzo in Action</h2>

<h2>Summary and TODO</h2>

<p>Right now what is shown here is basically the extent of <strong>Gonzo's</strong> functionality.  It's very young, but I plan to develop it aggressively.  After this post, all of my blog content will likely first be written in markdown in <strong>Gonzo</strong>.  I welcome contributors to the <a href="https://github.com/tonylukasavage/Gonzo">Gonzo Github repository</a>, but in all honesty, I'd wait a week or two before joining in.  Its likely to change A LOT over that period of time.</p>

<p>I'll end with the current TODO list for Gonzo.  Please feel free to add your own idea in the comments.</p>

<ul>
<li>Add ability to edit and apply CSS within Gonzo</li>
<li>More robust "project" environment to allow grouping of markdown and CSS with generated HTML</li>
<li>Spell Checker, likely via <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/squiggly/">Squiggly</a></li>
<li>Major UI polish <em>(gonna need help here)</em></li>
<li>Create Mac and Windows native downloads on the <a href="https://github.com/tonylukasavage/Gonzo">Github site</a></li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>The Code</h2>


<ul style="padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px;">
    <li><a href="https://github.com/tonylukasavage/Repper-playbook" target="_blank">Repper-playbook on Github</a> -- Full source code and Flash Builder "Burrito" project files</li>
</ul>




<h2>The Overview</h2>


<p>I mentioned this week that if you hustle you can still get yourself a <a href="http://us.blackberry.com/developers/tablet/playbook_offer.jsp" target="_blank">free Blackberry Playbook</a>.  Just follow <a href="http://savagelook.com/blog/actionscript3/procrastinators-guide-to-a-free-blackberry-playbook">my procrastinator's guide</a> and you could very well still have enough time to make it.  I also made posted a while ago the incredibly simple process of porting <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=air.Repper" target="_blank">Repper</a>, my fitness calculator mobile app written with <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flexsdk_hero/" target="_blank">Flex "Hero"</a>, to the Playbook.  If that wasn't enough for you, here's one more bit of charity to motivate to try and beat that March 31st, 2011 deadline to submit an app for a free Playbook.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://github.com/tonylukasavage/Repper-playbook" target="_blank">Github link</a> at the top I've included the full source and project files for Flash Builder "Burrito" for Repper.  Yep, everything it took to make a Playbook app that was submitted and approved is included within.  Take a look, pull it down, load it up, and see how a simple, functional app can get you a free tablet.  If you are wondering what your time is worth in comparison to the effort necessary, the model that developers are likely to receive (16 GB) is being priced at $500.  Seems a fair trade for a few hours of your time.</p>

<p>So now you have a guide to getting a Blackberry Playbook app submitted as quickly as possible and full source code for a project that has already been approved.  Pair that with the fact that I've not heard of one functional app not being approved, you are completely out of excuses to not cash in on this offer.  Dig in and get it done.</p>

    <id>http://tonylukasavage.github.com/blog/2011/03/21/procrastinator-s-guide-to-a-free-blackberry-playbook</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This past week my fitness calculator app, Repper, was approved for the Blackberry App World.  In return for enduring Research in Motion's arduous app submission process, I will be awarded with a free <a href="http://us.blackberry.com/playbook-tablet/" target="_blank">Blackberry Playbook</a> once they are officially released to the public.  Because I'm so pleased with this news, I thought I would share what I perceive as the easiest route to getting your hands on a free Playbook yourself.</p>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">You only have til March 31st to submit your app</span>, according to the <a href="http://us.blackberry.com/developers/tablet/playbook_offer.jsp" target="_blank">latest version of their offer</a>.  While this date has been pushed back a number of times, I suspect this may be the hard deadline.  You don't need to be approved by the due date, you just need to have your app submitted.  You may think I'm exaggerating here, but creating the app is the easy part, submitting is the real pain in the ass.</p>

<p>So before I get into too many boring details, let me lay out the list of things you need to do in order to reduce the amount of surprise time sucks you will encounter:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://appworld.blackberry.com/isvportal/signup/signupterms.seam?pageIndex=1&amp;cid=295177" target="_blank">Sign up to be a Blackberry vendor</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.blackberry.com/SignedKeys/" target="_blank">Get your code signing keys</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://us.blackberry.com/developers/tablet/adobe.jsp" target="_blank">Follow the getting started guide</a> for setting up your AS3/Flex development environment (or <a href="http://us.blackberry.com/developers/tablet/webworks.jsp" target="_blank">WebWorks</a> if that's your thing)</li>
    <li>Convert an existing AS3/Flex project or create a new app (<strong>IF YOU ONLY READ ONE SECTION, READ THIS</strong>)</li>
    <li><a href="http://docs.blackberry.com/en/developers/deliverables/23959/Signing_your_application_1422721_11.jsp" target="_blank">Sign</a> and submit your app to the Blackberry App World through the <a href="https://appworld.blackberry.com/isvportal/home/login.seam?pageIndex=1&amp;cid=296029" target="_blank">vendor portal</a>.</li>
    <li>Wait for approval</li>
</ul>


<p>The steps necessary are listed in a very specific order to maximize efficiency, particularly becoming a vendor and getting code signing keys.  Read the section below detailing each step to find out why.  So again, <strong>DO THE STEPS IN ORDER</strong>, it will save you time in the end.</p>

<h2>Sign up to be a Blackberry vendor</h2>


<p>This is simple enough. You just need to fill out a form with relevant personal information do that Blackberry has a record of who you are.  In the early stages of this process you actually needed to submit a notarized letter, if you were an individual and not a company, in order to complete the registration.  From what I understand this is no longer required so it should make your life a little easier.</p>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Blackberry is also waiving their usual $200 registration fee for developers during this period</span>.  So whether or not you plan to hit this deadline, it may be worthwhile just to sign up and get in for free.</p>

<p>You will do this first because this process may take a few business days to complete.  They review the vendor registration submissions and Blackberry has not been terribly quick with approvals at any step in this process.  In fact, that is the most common complaint about the app submission process so far is simply how long it takes to complete.  So get this done first and don't wait for approval to move on to the next step.</p>

<h2>Get your code signing keys</h2>


<p>This is another step that is as simple as filling out forms, but again requires Blackberry's intervention to approve.  Also bear in mind that the code signing key you will receive will only work on one workstation once registered and cannot be transfered to another workstation.  You have to request another key is you want it to work on another workstation.  I have requested 2 keys thus far and both have taken at least 2 business days to arrive via email.</p>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Like the last step, get this done now and don't wait for the key to arrive to move on</span>.  Hopefully by the time you are ready to submit your app to the App World you'll have received your vendor approval and signing key.</p>

<h2>Follow the Getting Started Guide</h2>


<p>I'm not going to go into a great deal of detail here because the Blackberry documentation lays it out very well.  Just follow <a href="http://us.blackberry.com/developers/tablet/adobe.jsp" target="_blank">the guide found here</a> and you'll be fast on your way to your Blackberry Playbook "Hello, World!".</p>

<p>One thing to keep in mind is that you must be building against the 0.9.4 SDK. I initially made the mistake of hanging on to the old 0.9.3 SDK and Blackberry has requested that I rebuild against the latest version before being able to make my app available on the App World.  Its not a huge deal, but will require you to go through the whole app update process if you don't do it right the first time.  That said, they still extended me the offer of the free Playbook without yet having made this change.</p>

<h2>Create your app</h2>


<p>I know, I'm trivializing what sounds like a big step.  But here's the thing: <span style="color: #ff0000;">I've not heard of one Playbook app that has been turned down due to perceived usefulness or quality</span>.  The only apps that I have heard being rejected are ones that actually don't work.  This is common in the case of people trying to implement multitouch or gesture support when the simulator does not properly emulate the behavior.</p>

<p>In other words, put together a simple application that is useful to a niche group.  Or better yet, convert an existing AS3 or Flex Hero project to a Playbook app.  Check out my prior post to see how I did this in literally seconds.</p>

<p>For me, Repper was a no brainer.  It is a simple fitness calculator that determines your 1-15 rep max on exercises.  It was originally built using Flex Hero in Air for Android.  Its currently available on the <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=air.Repper" target="_blank">Android Market</a> if you wanna take a look at it there.  You can see there is no rocket science.  Blackberry has no high expectations for the functionality of an app for which developers have no device.  KISS is the key factor here.  Wait til you have one of these Playbooks in your hand before you try to get really creative with it.</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm not encouraging fart app development here.  I'm just saying that at this point in the game Blackberry is happy handing out Playbooks to competent, motivated developers.  The quality of this one app is not what they are banking on.  They are hoping that with their generous gesture that they may woo more than a handful of mobile developers to spend their time on Blackberry Playbook apps rather than iPad or Android tablets.</p>

<p>In short, no excuses.  Create a useful, simple app.  Its not that hard and you know it.</p>

<h2>Submit your app to the App World</h2>


<p>Before digging into the specifics of the submission and signing process, here's the things you'll need:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Your signing certificate (CSJ file)</li>
    <li>A less than 4000 character description of your app</li>
    <li>A 480x480 product image for the App World</li>
    <li>At least one screenshot that is no larger than 640x640</li>
    <li>An 86x86 PNG icon, which includes a 5 pixel transparent buffer around it.  This effectively makes the icon content 76x76 or less.</li>
</ul>


<p>First you are going to sign your release build of your application using your CSJ signing certificate.  This is an intimidating and somewhat complex process.  I highly suggest picking from the choices at the bottom of their <a href="http://docs.blackberry.com/en/developers/deliverables/23959/Signing_your_application_1422721_11.jsp" target="_blank">code signing guide</a> and following them to the letter.  I personally had no problems with the workflow for signing apps through Flash Builder 4.5 "Burrito", but I've heard that some people had issues.  The safest route might be to follow the command line instructions for the entire process.  Again I emphasize, follow the instructions to the letter and don't try to frankenstein multiple guides together, it makes it harder to troubleshoot the issues.</p>

<p>After you have successfully signed your app, you just need to submit it to the App World through the <a href="https://appworld.blackberry.com/isvportal/home/login.seam?pageIndex=1&amp;cid=297207" target="_blank">vendor portal</a>. Just go to "Manage Products" and click the "Add Product..." button.  You will be walked through the steps necessary to submit your signed BAR app file.  So long as you have all the items I mentioned above in the list, and a successfully signed app, it should be pretty smooth sailing.  Finding these things out during the submission process was quite frustrating.</p>

<p>Carve out at least an hour for the above process, because it will take some time.  The code signing can be especially time consuming from the command line, but it seems to be the one sure fire way to get the app successfully signed.</p>

<p>If you followed my advice and became a vendor and requested your signing keys first, you won't find yourself waiting for days once you've reached this part of the process... like I did.</p>

<h2>Wait for approval</h2>


<p>Now that you finally have your app submitted, you just have to sit back and relax... and relax.... and relax... and do your taxes... and ge your car inspected... and renew your driver's license... you get the idea.  It takes a LONG time to get approved.  I've not heard of anyone getting their first app approved in under 2.5 weeks, with many waiting as long as 7.  But once again, as long as you get the app submitted before the deadline, you are still eligible for the free Playbook.</p>

<p>Once you finally do get approved you'll receive an email telling you as much.  It may also include additional steps you must take in order for your app to be made available in the App World, like mine did.  Shortly following this, for me it was a day later, you'll receive a congratulations notice for your free Playbook.  Included in this email should be a link to a purchase order for your Playbook with a cost of $0.00.  <span style="color: #ff0000;">I have not heard of a single case where an app was approved but the developer did not receive a free Playbook offer</span>.  Fill it out, send it in, and join us in the patient wait for the release date.</p>

<p>Hope you follow these steps and find yourself with your very own free Blackberry Playbook too!  Let me know if you happen upon success yourself.</p>

    <id>http://tonylukasavage.github.com/blog/2011/03/01/-3d-in-flash--and--away3d-3-6-essentials-</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There's been a lot of talk as of this weekend about 3D in Flash, due to Adobe's announcement that <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flashplatformruntimes/incubator/">Flash Player 11 is now available at Adobe Labs</a>.  Included in Flash Player is the much anticipated "Molehill" 3D API.  To get an idea of how huge of a leap in terms of rendering this is for Flash, take a look at some of <a href="http://savagelook.com/blog/away3d/adobe-molehill-3d-api-videos">these videos</a> I posted a few months back.  Or better yet, experience it yourself by playing "Zombie Tycoon"!</p>

<p>Right in step with Adobe's announcement came one from the Away3D team.  They unveiled the alpha version of <a href="http://away3d.com/away3d-4-0-alpha-release-broomstick">Away3D 4.0 "Broomstick"</a>.  This is the first version of my favorite 3D Flash engine that leverages the power of the Adobe "Molehill" API.  Check out the <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flashplatformruntimes/incubator/features/molehill.html">Adobe Labs page for Molehill</a> to see more of what Away3D will let you do, without having to get into the nitty, gritty details of Molehill.</p>

<p>In order to get a jump start on your Away3D development, I'd highly suggest picking up one (or both, like me) of these books: "The Essential Guide to 3D in Flash" and "Away3D 3.6 Essentials".  Both are great guides to getting started with Away3D,  as well as 3D graphics in Flash in general.  While no longer the latest and greatest, they will undoubtedly continue to give great insight for aspiring Away3D developers.</p>

<p>As these are both great texts, I'm not going to put their attributes side by side and compare every detail.  Instead I'm just going to point out the highlights of each.  You really can't go wrong with either.</p>

<h2><strong>"Away3D 3.6 Essentials" Highlights</strong></h2>


<ul>
    <li>The clearest highlight is without question the <span style="color: #ff0000;">choice of technical reviewer... Tony Lukasavage (see also, me).</span></li>
    <li>Matthew Casperson is the author and his <a href="http://www.brighthub.com/hubfolio/matthew-casperson.aspx" target="_blank">brighthub.com work</a> was the home for some of my earliest lessons in Away3D. Great demos and tutorials.</li>
    <li>Gives an extremely detailed look at the objects in Away3D, even laying out the initialization objects for many of the classes.  May not sound like a big deal, but Away3D makes heavy use of init objects for class constructors.  The only way to know how to use them without a reference is to go digging through the source.</li>
    <li>Answers one of the most frequently asked questions in Away3D with a simple chart: Which lights affect which materials?</li>
    <li>While both books discuss and explain model animation, this book delves into the sometimes baffling territory of how to properly export rigged models from popular modeling and animation program for use with Away3D.  In most cases its not as simple or intuitive as you might expect and this little extra help can go a long way.</li>
    <li>This book branches out a little further than "3D in Flash", discussing topics like particle engines, pixelbender shaders, and postprocessing as they pertain to Away3D.</li>
</ul>


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>"The Essential Guide to 3D in Flash" Highlights</h2>


<ul>
    <li>The authors are none other than <a href="http://www.infiniteturtles.co.uk/blog/" target="_blank">Rob Bateman</a> and <a href="http://richardolsson.se/" target="_blank">Richard Olsson</a>, cofounder and core developer for Away3D.  There's no disputing that getting the information from the crafters of the engine cannot be beat.</li>
    <li>Includes set up instructions for <a href="https://www.cleverbridge.com/429/?affiliate=15006&amp;scope=cart&amp;cart=71011" target="_blank">FDT</a>.</li>
    <li>While "Away3D 3.6 Essentials" gives a brief look at the differences between point, directional, and ambient lights, "3D in Flash" gives a very detailed description of each.  Paragraphs of information and easy to grasp visuals paint a much more clear picture of just how light works.</li>
    <li>Contains a great example of how you can programmatically animate rigged models.  In some cases even when you follow all the rules, imported animations don't work quite right.  This valuable example lets you take the animation into your own hands.</li>
</ul>


<p>I could go on with more, but beyond this, its just splitting hairs.  Both books are so good it's a great choice either way.</p>

<p>If you are serious about picking up Away3D for 3D Flash development and want the quickest path to success, either one will do just fine.  Just be sure to follow it all and actually code along with the examples.  That's where a lot of the real value in these books lies.  And be sure you make it to the end where possibly the most important topic lies for each book: performance.  But then again, with the coming of "Molehill", those performance concerns might not be quite so critical anymore.</p>
