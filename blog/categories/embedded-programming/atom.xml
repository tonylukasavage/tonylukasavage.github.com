    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Time to dive into the world of embedded programming head long with one of my favorite Christmas gifts: my <a href="http://www.nerdkits.com/">NerdKit</a>.  What's a NerdKit?  Well its basically a starter kit for bridging programming with the real world through electronics, an API, and a thorough guide for getting started.  You might have also heard of <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>, which is a similar and uses open source technology for embedded programming.</p>

<p>What can you do with it?  Well, thats what I aim to find out.  In the meantime, though, you can check out the <a href="http://www.nerdkits.com/projects/">"Projects" page</a> of the NerdKits site for some pretty damn cool projects that include:</p>

<ul>
<li>iPhone controlled RC Car</li>
<li>Morse Code decoder</li>
<li>Digital thermometers</li>
<li>Spark generator</li>
<li>Computer controlled robotics and devices</li>
</ul>


<p>So for all you SavageLook.com faithful there's sure to be some NerdKit guides and demos to come.  Here's hoping I haven't forgotten every bit of electrical engineering I learned in college.  Forget it, I drank that knowledge clean outta my head.  I guess 3 hours/week of EE can't compete with 12 hours/week of beer pong.  Oh well, should be fun anyway!</p>

<p>Oh and be sure to follow <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/nerdkits">@nerdkits</a> on twitter for all kinds of cool updates, demos, and tutorials!</p>
